# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile banking backend application built with Java and Spring Boot. The system will provide core banking functionality including user authentication, wallet management, and money transfers using Domain Driven Design principles. The application will be structured around key domain concepts: User Management, Authentication, and Transaction Processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new customer, I want to register for a banking account with my personal details, so that I can access mobile banking services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides name, phone number, and PIN THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with a unique identifier
2. WHEN a user registers with an existing phone number THEN the system SHALL reject the registration and return an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user provides a PIN THEN the system SHALL hash and securely store the PIN
4. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL initialize their wallet balance to zero
5. IF the registration data is invalid THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific field information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to authenticate using my phone number and PIN, so that I can securely access my banking account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid phone number and PIN THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return a JWT token
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the login attempt and return an authentication error
3. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL generate a JWT token with appropriate expiration time
4. WHEN a JWT token is used for API access THEN the system SHALL validate the token and extract user identity
5. IF a JWT token is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an unauthorized error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view my current wallet balance, so that I can know how much money I have available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user requests their balance THEN the system SHALL return their current wallet balance
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user requests balance THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an unauthorized error
3. WHEN the balance is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return the amount with proper decimal precision
4. IF the user account doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to transfer money to another user, so that I can send payments to friends and family.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a transfer with valid recipient and amount THEN the system SHALL process the transaction atomically
2. WHEN a user has insufficient balance THEN the system SHALL reject the transfer and return an insufficient funds error
3. WHEN a transfer is successful THEN the system SHALL debit the sender's account and credit the receiver's account
4. WHEN a transfer is successful THEN the system SHALL create a transaction record with sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp
5. WHEN the recipient doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL reject the transfer with a user not found error
6. IF a transfer fails for any reason THEN the system SHALL ensure no partial updates occur (atomicity)
7. WHEN a user tries to transfer to themselves THEN the system SHALL reject the transfer with an appropriate error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view my transaction history, so that I can track my financial activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests transaction history THEN the system SHALL return all transactions where they are sender or receiver
2. WHEN displaying transactions THEN the system SHALL include transaction ID, amount, timestamp, and counterparty information
3. WHEN displaying transactions THEN the system SHALL order them by timestamp in descending order (most recent first)
4. WHEN an unauthenticated user requests transaction history THEN the system SHALL reject the request
5. IF a user has no transactions THEN the system SHALL return an empty list

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to add funds to my wallet, so that I can increase my available balance for transfers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to add funds with a valid amount THEN the system SHALL increase their wallet balance
2. WHEN a user provides an invalid amount (negative or zero) THEN the system SHALL reject the request with a validation error
3. WHEN funds are added successfully THEN the system SHALL create a transaction record indicating the fund addition
4. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to add funds THEN the system SHALL reject the request
5. IF the fund addition fails THEN the system SHALL ensure the balance remains unchanged

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all financial transactions to be processed securely and atomically, so that data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any financial transaction occurs THEN the system SHALL wrap the operation in a database transaction
2. WHEN a transaction fails partially THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes to maintain consistency
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL use appropriate encryption and hashing
4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authentication and authorization
5. IF concurrent transactions affect the same account THEN the system SHALL handle them safely without race conditions
