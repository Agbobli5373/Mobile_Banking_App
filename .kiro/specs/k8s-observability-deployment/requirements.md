# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the mobile banking backend application to be deployed to Kubernetes with comprehensive observability capabilities including monitoring, tracing, and logging. The solution will provide production-ready deployment configurations with Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards for visualization, distributed tracing, and centralized logging to ensure operational visibility and troubleshooting capabilities for the Spring Boot backend service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the mobile banking backend application to Kubernetes, so that I can have a scalable and manageable containerized deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend application is containerized THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image for the Spring Boot application
2. WHEN Kubernetes manifests are applied THEN the system SHALL deploy the backend with proper resource limits and health checks
3. WHEN the backend starts in Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL be accessible through service endpoints and ingress controllers
4. IF database connectivity is required THEN the system SHALL configure PostgreSQL deployment with persistent storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want Prometheus metrics collection enabled, so that I can monitor backend application performance and system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend application starts THEN the system SHALL expose metrics endpoints for Prometheus scraping
2. WHEN Prometheus is deployed THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and scrape backend application metrics
3. WHEN custom business metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide application-specific metrics for transactions, user registrations, and wallet operations
4. IF metric collection fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating without affecting core backend functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Grafana dashboards configured, so that I can visualize backend system metrics and create alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Grafana is deployed THEN the system SHALL automatically configure Prometheus as a data source
2. WHEN dashboards are imported THEN the system SHALL display backend application metrics, JVM metrics, and infrastructure metrics
3. WHEN alert conditions are met THEN the system SHALL trigger notifications through configured channels
4. IF dashboard configuration changes THEN the system SHALL persist configurations through ConfigMaps or persistent volumes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distributed tracing enabled, so that I can trace requests through the backend application and identify performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request enters the backend THEN the system SHALL generate trace IDs and propagate them across internal service calls
2. WHEN tracing data is collected THEN the system SHALL send traces to a tracing backend (Jaeger or Zipkin)
3. WHEN trace analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed request flow visualization within the backend
4. IF tracing overhead becomes significant THEN the system SHALL support configurable sampling rates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a support engineer, I want centralized logging configured, so that I can troubleshoot issues in the backend application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend application generates logs THEN the system SHALL collect and forward logs to a centralized logging system
2. WHEN log analysis is required THEN the system SHALL provide searchable and filterable log aggregation
3. WHEN log correlation is needed THEN the system SHALL include trace IDs in log entries
4. IF log volume becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL support log level configuration and retention policies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper secrets management in Kubernetes, so that sensitive configuration data is securely handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is required THEN the system SHALL use Kubernetes Secrets for database passwords, JWT keys, and API tokens
2. WHEN secrets are accessed THEN the system SHALL mount them securely into containers
3. WHEN secret rotation is needed THEN the system SHALL support updating secrets without application downtime
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL restrict secret access through RBAC policies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want health checks and readiness probes configured, so that Kubernetes can manage backend application lifecycle properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend pods start THEN the system SHALL perform readiness checks before routing traffic
2. WHEN the backend application becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL restart containers automatically
3. WHEN rolling updates occur THEN the system SHALL ensure zero-downtime deployments
4. IF health check endpoints fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want PostgreSQL database deployed in Kubernetes, so that the backend application has persistent and reliable data storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PostgreSQL is deployed THEN the system SHALL use persistent volumes for data storage
2. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and proper resource limits
3. WHEN database credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL store them securely using Kubernetes Secrets
4. IF database backup is required THEN the system SHALL support automated backup strategies
5. WHEN database monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL expose PostgreSQL metrics for Prometheus collection

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want resource management configured, so that the backend application has appropriate CPU and memory allocations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend pods are scheduled THEN the system SHALL enforce resource requests and limits
2. WHEN resource usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL handle resource constraints gracefully
3. WHEN horizontal scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration for the backend
4. IF resource contention occurs THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical backend application components
