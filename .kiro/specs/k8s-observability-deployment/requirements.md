# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the mobile banking backend application to be deployed using Docker Compose with comprehensive observability capabilities including monitoring, tracing, and logging. The solution will provide development and production-ready deployment configurations with Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards for visualization, distributed tracing, and centralized logging to ensure operational visibility and troubleshooting capabilities for the Spring Boot backend service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the mobile banking backend application using Docker Compose, so that I can have a simple and manageable containerized deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend application is containerized THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image for the Spring Boot application
2. WHEN Docker Compose is started THEN the system SHALL deploy the backend with proper resource limits and health checks
3. WHEN the backend starts with Docker Compose THEN the system SHALL be accessible through defined ports and service networking
4. IF database connectivity is required THEN the system SHALL configure PostgreSQL service with persistent volumes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want Prometheus metrics collection enabled, so that I can monitor backend application performance and system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend application starts THEN the system SHALL expose metrics endpoints for Prometheus scraping
2. WHEN Prometheus is deployed THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and scrape backend application metrics
3. WHEN custom business metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide application-specific metrics for transactions, user registrations, and wallet operations
4. IF metric collection fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating without affecting core backend functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Grafana dashboards configured, so that I can visualize backend system metrics and create alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Grafana is deployed THEN the system SHALL automatically configure Prometheus as a data source
2. WHEN dashboards are imported THEN the system SHALL display backend application metrics, JVM metrics, and infrastructure metrics
3. WHEN alert conditions are met THEN the system SHALL trigger notifications through configured channels
4. IF dashboard configuration changes THEN the system SHALL persist configurations through ConfigMaps or persistent volumes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distributed tracing enabled, so that I can trace requests through the backend application and identify performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request enters the backend THEN the system SHALL generate trace IDs and propagate them across internal service calls
2. WHEN tracing data is collected THEN the system SHALL send traces to a tracing backend (Jaeger or Zipkin)
3. WHEN trace analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed request flow visualization within the backend
4. IF tracing overhead becomes significant THEN the system SHALL support configurable sampling rates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a support engineer, I want centralized logging configured, so that I can troubleshoot issues in the backend application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend application generates logs THEN the system SHALL collect and forward logs to a centralized logging system
2. WHEN log analysis is required THEN the system SHALL provide searchable and filterable log aggregation
3. WHEN log correlation is needed THEN the system SHALL include trace IDs in log entries
4. IF log volume becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL support log level configuration and retention policies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper secrets management in Docker Compose, so that sensitive configuration data is securely handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is required THEN the system SHALL use Docker Compose secrets or environment files for database passwords, JWT keys, and API tokens
2. WHEN secrets are accessed THEN the system SHALL load them securely into containers through environment variables or mounted files
3. WHEN secret rotation is needed THEN the system SHALL support updating secrets through environment file changes
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL restrict secret access through proper file permissions and container isolation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want health checks configured, so that Docker Compose can manage backend application lifecycle properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend containers start THEN the system SHALL perform health checks before considering the service ready
2. WHEN the backend application becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL restart containers automatically through Docker health checks
3. WHEN service updates occur THEN the system SHALL support graceful container replacement
4. IF health check endpoints fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want PostgreSQL database deployed with Docker Compose, so that the backend application has persistent and reliable data storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PostgreSQL is deployed THEN the system SHALL use Docker volumes for data persistence
2. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and proper resource limits
3. WHEN database credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL store them securely using environment files or Docker secrets
4. IF database backup is required THEN the system SHALL support volume-based backup strategies
5. WHEN database monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL expose PostgreSQL metrics for Prometheus collection

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want resource management configured, so that the backend application has appropriate CPU and memory allocations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend containers are started THEN the system SHALL enforce resource limits through Docker Compose configuration
2. WHEN resource usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL handle resource constraints gracefully
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support Docker Compose scaling for multiple backend instances
4. IF resource contention occurs THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical backend application components
