# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a modern mobile banking frontend application built with React and TailwindCSS. The frontend will provide a responsive, accessible, and intuitive user interface for the mobile banking backend system. The application will support all existing backend features while being designed to accommodate future enhancements. The frontend will be structured around key user workflows: onboarding, authentication, wallet management, and transaction processing.
